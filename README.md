# INDIA-GENERAL-ELECTIONS-RESULT-ANALYSIS-2024

Project Overview
This project analyzes the results of the 2024 Indian General Elections using SQL queries to provide insights on seat distribution, party performance, and voting patterns across various states and constituencies.

The analysis is focused on breaking down the number of seats won by key alliances (NDA, I.N.D.I.A., and Other), as well as detailed views into individual constituencies and overall election results.

Key Features
Total Seats Analysis: Calculate the total number of seats available for elections across all states.
Party-wise Seat Distribution: Identify the seats won by different political alliances (NDA, I.N.D.I.A., and others).
State-wise Seat Breakdown: Analyze the seats won by each alliance at the state level.
Constituency Performance: Drill down into individual constituencies to find out the winning candidate, party affiliation, total votes, and margin of victory.
Voting Patterns: Compare votes received through Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs) vs. postal ballots.
Ranking Candidates: Determine the winners and runners-up in each constituency based on total votes.
